After weeks of wading through deep swamps in the rainforest, you had arrived
where your map clearly indicates the ruins of the capital of the ancient
Yendori civilization. Alas, after searching the place for days, you had come
to the sad realization that the town was long gone, sunk deep into the
marshland.

You were leaving the area, mentally preparing for the long trip back to the
coast, when the metal sole of your boot clunked against something under the
mud. Looking closer, you realize it's a block of stone!

After a few days of digging, you have entirely uncovered the roof of an ancient
tower. There are remnants of what you can only guess is a telescope mount on
the floor, suggesting that this could be the master tower of Karinge. At the
center of the roof is a usable staircase.

You pack your belongings and take the staircase down.
